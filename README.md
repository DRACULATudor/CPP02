# CPP Module 02 - 42 School

## Overview
This project is part of the **C++ Modules** at **42 School**, designed to deepen knowledge of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. It introduces **function overloading, operator overloading, memory allocation (`new` / `delete`), and the canonical form of classes**.

## Topics Covered

    Function Overloading
    Operator Overloading (+, -, =, <<, etc.)
    Memory Allocation (new / delete)
    References (&)
    The Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF)
    Best practices for class structure


## Compilation

``
Compile the project:
```
make

```
Or, if there is no Makefile:
```
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program
```
Run the program:
```
./exec_name(check Makefile)
```
## Usage
```
Run the compiled program to experiment with function overloading, operator overloading, and proper class design.
